Example 1:  Run linpack
burden -t linpack -j 1 -c "m5.xlarge[zone=c&region=us-east-1]" -d 1 -i 1 -p testing -P virtual-guest -o rhel -T 1 -v aws -O ami-myaminumber -C 1

Will run linpack with the following settings
	Java version: 11
	cloud vendor: aws
        cloud instance: m5.xlarge
	cloud region: us-east-1
	cloud zone: c
	will use ssh perm file located in config
        will run linpack 1 pass
	run directory will be prefixed with testing
	will use tuned virtual-guest
	RHEL is the os vendor
	will terminate the image once the test is completed
	OS image from AWS is ami-myaminumber
	run the test

Example 2: Simply create a cloud image
burden -j 1 -c "m5.xlarge" -d 1 -i 1 -P virtual-guest -o rhel -T 0 -v aws -O ami-myaminumber -C 0

	Java version: 11
	cloud vendor: aws
        cloud instance: m5.xlarge
	cloud region: user default
	cloud zone: random
	will use ssh perm file located in config
	RHEL is the os vendor
	OS image from AWS is ami-myaminumber

Example 3: Simply create a cloud image, and upload all packages and tools
burden -j 1 -c "m5.xlarge" -d 1 -i 1 -P virtual-guest -o rhel -T 0 -v aws -O ami-myaminumber -C 0 -U
	Only difference from example #2 is the -U option.  That will force the upload of all packages
        and tools.
