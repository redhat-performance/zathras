// Back ground information start
== Background
=== Origin of name
The name Zathras is from a character in the TV series Babylon 5 written by J. Michael Straczynski. In
the series, Zathras says “Zathras is used to being a beast of burden to other people's needs.” Given the
main purpose of this tool is to provision a large number of systems, and then coordinate the execution
of tests across those systems, it seemed an appropriate name.

=== Born out of necessity
As part of performance analysis work, running and gathering instrumentation data is the foundation.
The process of provisioning and running tests manually is fine if you are working with a limited
number of systems and workloads. However, when either one of those axises grows, it becomes
cumbersome to deal with, much less to be able to get repeatable data. In our initial work we were
looking at running five workloads each across five machine types. That presented a total of 25 tests
to run, and 5 different cloud systems to provision every time we wanted to run the series of tests.
Another item we had to consider was that we were paying for the cloud instance on an hourly rate, so
we needed to have the instance shut down once the tests had completed, which could be at 2:00 in the
morning. At the end of this work the system count had grown to over 17 cloud systems, making it even
more critical.

=== Overall design goals
. System type support is provided via “plug-able” ansible modules. Very little knowledge of the
system type will reside outside of the module, and when present, there needs to be a strong
technical reason for it.
. To keep system types contained, there will be no shared code between system type modules. A
system-type-specific module may call a generic module, but that module will have no
knowledge specific to a system type.
. Tests are provided via plugins and Zathras will have no knowledge of any test. The test is
defined in a configuration file that is used by Zathras.
. Each test is its own standalone entity. The wrapper around the test does not have to run via
Zathras.
. Ability to change the parameters to the test without changing any bash or ansible scripts.
. There is no limit on the system types that can be supported. All Zathras requires to run a test is
a valid ip address that it can ssh to.
. System configuration modules have to support the addition of devices, networks and the
creation of the network clients. Note: the only exception is for local systems; that information
is provided by the user via a config file
. Cloud provider modules must provide a tear down operation. At the end of the test(s), Zathras
will call the appropriate tear down operation. This operation provides the minimum features:
.. Shut down the instance.
.. Destroy the cloud instance.
.. Destroy any storage allocated.
.. Remove any networks created (includes any subnets, vlans, VPCs, etc. created).
.. Any network clients that were created are removed and appropriate clean up is done.
. Support running multiple systems at the same time. Systems do not have to be of the same
type.

=== Clouds currently supported (provisions and tears the system down)
. AWS cloud
. Azure cloud
. GCP cloud

=== Local system supported
. Any system that can be ssh'd into without a passwd

=== Future support
. KVMs
. IBM Cloud

=== Zathras is not
. A test in itself. It simply launches the test.
. A data repository. Zathras will retrieve the test results if told to do so. It is the test wrapper’s responsibility for any data archiving.
. A data reduction tool. Any data reduction is handled by the wrapper, or secondary set of tools.

== Setting up Zathras

=== Installing Zathras
Zathras resides in a RH-internal gitlab repository (change this when moved to github). To install it on your system, issue the following
command:

$ git clone https:// gitlab.zathras.com/dvalin/zathras <directory>

=== Configuring Zathras
The only configuration Zathras requires is the ability to ssh to the system without a password. In the
case of the cloud environments this happens by default (including su to root without a password). In
the case of bare metal systems, if the test system is not set up for you to log in as root without a
password, you will need to add the appropriate ssh key to the test system. Use ssh-copy-id or a
similar method to copy the proper config file to the test system.

== Zathras Operational Overview
The only command the user uses is burden . The options to zathras are provided by the CLI or via a
test scenario file.

=== Test scenario files
Defining the tests to run via a test scenario file has numerous advantages over the CLI, these
advantages include:

. Greater flexibility in defining tests.
. Ability to make complex test runs.
. Once created, can easily be exported for future use.
. Easier to modify a test.

==== Format of scenario file
----
global:
  <global options>
systems:
  system1:
    <options for system1>
  system2:
    <options for system 2>
----
There is a special host name for host_config called SYS_BARRIER . When SYS_BARRIER is seen, no new tests will be
started until all the outstanding tests are completed. + 
 +
The options in the parameters file maps directly back to the CLI options, minus the dash.
 +
Example of running streams on the local bare metal system test_sys:

----
Run fio on AWS m5.xlarge with 2 disks, and then run uperf on AWS m5.xlarge, 1
network. Note the SYS_BARRIER that indicates we will pause at that point, wait for all tests to
finish, and then start the next batch. The m5.xlarge created for fio will be terminated at the
end of the fio run and a new m5.xlarge for the uperf run will be created:

In the above configuration, we have 2 known java versions, java-11 and java-8. The packages to install
are based on the version of linux we are using.
If we are running RHEL and want java-11, we will install the package java-11-openjdk-devel.
If a new version of java is available, say java-12, then the following addition to the config file will be
made (this is only an example):

Field definitions: +
*test<n>:* is a unique numerical value from the other tests. Other than for creation of the yml file, it
has no bearing on the test execution. +
*test_template:* Is a pointer to a specific test template that will be brought in.  Purpose is that when we need to make changes for a specifc test, we update the test_template file not the test_defs.yml. +
*test_name:* designates the name that zathras knows the test by. This name is what is passed in with
the --tests option. +
*test_description:* A brief description of what the test does. This information is displayed when the
--show_tests option is provided to burden. +
*repository_type:* The type of repository that the test is located in. Current valid values are +

. git_tar: Mainly used when pulling an entire git repository for a test. +
.  git_file: Designated when we are pulling a single file from a git repository
. git_tag: Will pull based on the git_tag.
. file: Indicates we are copying a file.
. tar: Indicates we are copying a tarball.

*location:* Is the location at which the test can be found. Note in the case of git, it will be everything
minus the actual location name. For example, if we have:
----
https://github.com/redhat-performance/streams-wrapper/

We will drop the streams-wrapper on the end and have

https://github.com/redhat-performance/
----
*version:* The version of the test to use. For a listing of versions available, you can issue the following command:
----
$ ./burden --test_versions streams
============================
streams
============================
v1.0            Merge pull request #2 from redhat-performance/fix_usage
----
*test_grouping :* Is the grouping name of the tests. In the case of a git repo, it will be the actual
location name. For example, if we have:
----
https://github.com/redhat-performance/streams-wrapper/
----
we drop everything but streams-wrapper and use "streams-wrapper" +
*os_supported:* What Operating Systems are supported. rhel, ubuntu, amazon or all. +
*reboot_system:* This is for cloud systems, and will reboot the cloud system once it has been created. +
*test_run_from:* Some tests need to run from the local system, not the cloud system (boot timing test
is one example). If local is specified, the test will run locally, if remote is specified the test will run on
the test system. +
*repo_file:* The archive file to be downloaded.  In the case of git repos, it will be <tag>.zip +
*rhel_pkgs:* RHEL packages that are required to run the test; “none” if there aren't any packaging requirements +
*ubuntu_pkgs:* Ubuntu packages that are required to run the test; “none” if there aren't any packaging requirements. +
*amazon_pkgs:* Amazon packages that are required to run the test; “none” if there aren't any packaging requirements. +
*pbench_required:* If set to yes, the test requires pbench to be installed to run. Zathras will install
pbench on the test system for you. Only supported for RHEL/Fedora. *Note:* it is the responsibility of the user to make sure the pbench repos are set up properly. +
*pbench_local_result:* If set to yes, will tell the various wrapper scripts to consolidate the pbench results into a results tarball in /tmp with the format:
----
results_<workload>_<tuned_setting>.tar
e.g.
results_pbench_linpack_tuned_virtual-guest_sys_file_none.tar
----
*storage_required:* If set to yes, Zathras will check to make sure storage has been designated for the system before provisioning it. +
*network_required:* If set to yes, Zathras will check to make sure a network (other than the defaults)
has been designated for the system before provisioning it. +
*java_required:* If set to yes, Zathras will make sure that a Java Version has been provided before provisioning any system. +
*archive_results:* Tell zathras that it has test results to retrieve from the test system. +
*test_script_to_run:* The script that Zathras is to run. +
*test_specific:* Test options that are specific to the test. +
*upload_extra:* If not set to “none”, uploads the each file in the comma separated list to the test system. +

=== default_template.yml
There is a special template file, that if present will fill in missing fields in the test_defs file.  This allows the user to consolidate items that have a general default into a file that is shared by every test template file.  If the entry appears in the test template file, it will override the entry in the default template.

== Adding a test
=== Requirements for adding a test
. The test is not allowed to prompt for any user input
. The test must handle full automation of its environment. That includes any filesystem or logical
volume creation.
. The test must recognize the following passed options (it may simply ignore them but must not error if they are passed in).  If the test is using https://github.com/dvalinrh/test_tools/general_setup (recommended), then these are automatically handled.
* --home_parent: Parent directory of the user's home directory. If the home directory is /home/test_user, then the value for this will be /home.
* --host_config <value>: default is the current host name
* --iterations : how many times we are to run the test.
* --pbench: use pbench-user-benchmark and place information into pbench, defaults to do not use
* --pbench_copy: Copy the pbench data, not move it.
* --pbench_user <value>: user who started everything. Defaults to the current user.
* --run_label: the label to associate with the pbench run
* --run_user : user running the test
* --sys_type : At this time will be one of: aws, azure, gcp or local.
* --sysname : name of the system we are running. In the case of cloud instances, this will be the name of the instance; this should be included in the results name
* --tuned_setting : tuned profile to use; this should be included in the results name
* --usage: this usage message
. Test must call invoke_test in the following manner to log the command execution and create a tuned results file
*	if [ ! -f "/tmp/${test_name}.out" ]; then
*		${TOOLS_BIN}/invoke_test --test_name ${test_name} --command ${0} --options "${arguments}"
*		exit $?
*	fi
*   $test_name is the name of the test, will be tagged to the stdout file
*   ${TOOLS_BIN} is the loction of the tools_bin binary
*   ${arguments} is the saved arguments.
. Test is also responsible for indicating if the test ran sucessfuly.  A value of "Ran" or "Failed" is placed in the file test_results_report.  It is the responsiblity of the test to save this file in the proper location. +
. Test is responsible for archiving any results to be passed back. That result information is placed
in a tarball located in /tmp and has the following naming convention: 
----
    results_<test running>_tuned_<tuned_config>_file_<sys settings>.tar
----
*  Note: Failure to have the results in that format will result in Zathras not being able to find the results of the test.

=== Adding a test to Zathras
. Edit the config/test_defs.yml file and copy one of the existing tests
. Change “ test<n>: ” to a unique <n> value; normally this is just incrementing the last test but that is not strictly required.
. Change “ test_name: ” to be the name you want to call the test.
. Change “ test_description: ” field to be the description for your test.
. Update repository_type, location and test_grouping to reflect where Zathras is to get the test from
. Change “ test_script_to_run: ” to be the name of the script Zathras is to run.
. If you have specific test options to be passed in, update the “ test_specific: ” field to have hose values, otherwise it must be the empty string “”.
. Update the remainder of the fields to your needs, see section 5.2 for more details on the available fields.

=== Example of adding a test to Zathras
* Test name: sample_test
* Options: standard options
* Test location: https://github.com/redhat-performance

== Files created from run
Zathras will create the following in the directory you are running it from.

. Results_directory: results_name/os_vendor/cloud_type/instance_type
* results_name: name is from the Zathras option --results_prefix 
* os_vendor: name is from the Zathras option --os_vendor
* cloud_type: name is from the Zathras opption --system_type
* instance_type: name is from the --host_config option, using just the first field.  There will be added to the end of the name _x where x is a numerical value
. The Results directory contains the information used to run the test as well as the results tarball.  Note we do not save any of the terraform creation information as it takes up too much space.
. failed_runs: created in the run directory if a test failed (test failed/passed is up to each test script).  Contained in the file will be 
*     timestamp system message
. ansible_log: log file of ansible output.
. results info: Created in the run directory, Contains the run information of all the tests.

== Host definition
Hosts are defined the same regardless whether they are passed on the command line or in a test
scenario file. The only difference in the full host definition is between local and cloud systems. With
local systems, we do not designate disk/network resources on the command line, but use a config file in
the directory local_config . For cloud systems, we designate the resources and the instance type as
string. +

=== Local system definition
Any system that is up and can be logged in to with ssh via an IP address or hostname can be viewed as
a local system. +
 +
For the CLI and test scenario file we simply use the host_config option to designate the system. For
the CLI this is done via: +
----
--host_config <host name or ip addr>
----
Via the test scenario file, we have this line in the file:
----
host_config: <host name or ip addr>
----
In the directory local_configs we have a file named <host_name>.config whose content gives the
system resources to use. That file format is defined in section 5.6. The settings in this file are what the
test will use for the various resources. Note Zathras does not understand anything about existing disk
information, and it is not a requirement of the test wrappers either. This means if you designate a disk
that has data you want to keep, it may very well be destroyed.

=== Cloud Systems
As part of the host config definition, the system resources will also be designated. As with local
systems, the definition format is the same between the CLI and test definition file +
Format of definition string: +
----
<cloud_instance_name>:<resource definition>&<resource definition>
----
cloud_instance_name : the name of the cloud instance type (e.g. m5.xlarge, Standard_D8s_v3). As
part of this definition you are able to designate the Region/zone to create the instance in, so in case of +
AWS: +
----
m5.xlarge[region=us-east-1&zone=b]
----
Will create an m5.xlarge image in the us-east-1 region, zone b. +
Resource definitions have the following format: +
Disk definition:
----
Disk:number=<n>;size=<y>;type=<t>
----
Where: +
* number= designates the number of disks to create. +
* size= designates the size of the disk in gigabytes. +
* type= designates the disk type. +
 +
Note: there is a special type that is called internal. Internal means the storage is internal
to the instance (ie i3en* in AWS, Lsv2 in Azure). If that is specified, you do not need to
worry about the number of disks or their size. You still may designate disks to create
which will be used as well as any internal disks discovered. This is required for those
instance types that have node-local storage as Zathras does not attempt to keep a list to
know when it is okay to not specify additional disks for benchmarks that require storage. +
 +
Network designation: +
----
Networks:number=1
----
sysctl designation
----
sysctl_settings=<file>+<file>
----
A list of files (that live in sysctl_settings) that have values
we are to set via sysctl. Each file is a complete run of the tests. File format: +
/proc/sys/net/core/netdev_max_backlog=10000 +

== URLs of interest
=== https://github.com/redhat-performance
Contains the publicly available test wrappers for Zathras.  The wrappers are suffixed with -wrapper.  Note, certain workloads require an upload of a binary package (linpack, spec*), those are not included because of licensing agreements.

=== https://github.com/redhat-performance/test_tools-wrappers
Contains a list of generic test tools that are used during execution of Zathras.  This is pulled in automatically via the test_wrapper and may be overridden by passing the option --tools_git <git location> to the wrapper.

[appendix]
== Execution Example
Note: Need to update the URL when we GA Zathras +
First clone the zathras code
----
$ git clone https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/dvalin/zathras zathras_exec

----
We want to run AWS m5.xlarge (x86), RHEL 9, need to locate the proper AMI
----
$ ./burden --show_os_versions --os_vendor rhel --system_type aws | egrep "RHEL-9.*x86"
|  2021-11-02T14:55:39.000Z|  RHEL-9.0.0_HVM_BETA-20211026-x86_64-10-Hourly2-GP2 |  ami-0fbec8a0a2beb6a71  |
----
Create the file aws_example with the following content
----
global:
  ssh_key_file: <your ssh key for the aws system>
  terminate_cloud: 1
  cloud_os_id: ami-0fbec8a0a2beb6a71
  os_vendor: rhel
  results_prefix: testing
  system_type: aws
systems:
  system1:
    tests: streams
    host_config: "m5.xlarge"
----
Now execute the desired test.
----
$ ./burden --scenario aws_example
----
There will be a large amount of messages displayed on the screeen.  When the test is complete, to look at the results
----
$ cd testing/aws/rhel
$ ls
$ cd testing/rhel/aws/m5.xlarge_0
$ ls res*str*tar
results_streams_tuned_none_sys_file_none.tar
$ tar xvf results_streams_tuned_none_sys_file_none.tar
----
Look for the csv file results_streams.csv +
Other information in the directory of interest +

. streams.cmd: the command that was run to execute the test
. boot_info directory: contains boot timing information
. cloud_timings: contains the time to start and terminate the instance
. meta_data.yml: meta data information on the system.

[appendix]
== Using scenario variables file

We will use the setup from the Appendix titled "Execution Example" +
Create the file config/scenario_example, containing the following information
----
aws_os_id: ami-0fbec8a0a2beb6a71
aws_host_config: m5.xlarge
azure_os_id: RedHat:RHEL:8-LVM:8.4.2021091103
azure_host_config: Standard_D8s_v3
----
Now modify the aws_example file created earlier to look like
----
global:
  ssh_key_file: <your ssh key for the aws system>
  terminate_cloud: 1
  cloud_os_id: [os_id]
  os_vendor: rhel
  results_prefix: testing
systems:
  system1:
    tests: streams
    host_config: [host_config]
----
To run the streams test on the AWS system
----
$ ./burden --scenario aws_example --scenario_vars config/scenario_example --system_type aws
----
To run the streams test on the Azure system
----
$ ./burden --scenario aws_example --scenario_vars config/scenario_example --system_type azure
----
This is a very simple example of using the scenario vars file, it becomes much more useful when dealing with
multiple workloads, with multiple resourcce requirements (disks, networks etc).

[appendix]
== Changing test options from the cli

Create the file aws_example with the following content
----
global:
  ssh_key_file: <your ssh key for the aws system>
  terminate_cloud: 1
  cloud_os_id: ami-0fbec8a0a2beb6a71
  os_vendor: rhel
  results_prefix: testing
  system_type: aws
systems:
  system1:
    tests: streams
    host_config: "m5.xlarge"
  system2:
    host_config: "SYS_BARRIER"
  system3:
    tests: streams
    host_config: "m5.xlarge"
----
Note we are using SYS_BARRIER to force the first test to complete, before starting the next test. +
We will designate that the streams test defined in system3, will use the AWS image m5.4xlarge, instead of m5.xlarge
To do this, we issue the following command
----
$ ./burden --scenario aws_example  --test_override "system3:host_config=m5.4.xlarge"
----
Looking at the generated results directories we see
----
$ ls doc_testing/rhel/aws
m5.4xlarge_0  m5.xlarge_0
----
So we ran both m5.4xlarge and m5.xlarge, not two m5.xlarges as designated in the scenario file.

[appendix]
=== Desginating multiple hardware architectures
Executing a scenario file, with multiple hardware architectures. +
Create the file aws_example with the following content
----
global:
  ssh_key_file: <your ssh key for the aws system>
  terminate_cloud: 1
  cloud_os_id: x86:ami-0fbec8a0a2beb6a71,arm64:ami-0cfa90ca3ebfc506e
  os_vendor: rhel
  results_prefix: testing
  system_type: aws
systems:
  system1:
    tests: streams
    host_config: "m6g.xlarge,m5.xlarge"
----
Run the following command
----
$ ./burden --scenario aws_example
----
Now take a look at the results directory
----
$ ls testing/aws/rhel
m5.xlarge_0  m6g.xlarge_0
----
We see that we ran both m5.xlarge (x86) and m6g.xlarge (arm64) systems.

[appendix]
=== Checking the test versions
To check the versions of all the tests are latest, run the following command
----
$ ./burden --test_version_check
Git version check.
                            Test     Using    latest    Ok
               aim7_template.yml      v1.0      v1.0   yes
                     autohpl.yml      v1.0      v1.1    no
                    burst_io.yml      v1.1      v1.2    no
       coremark_pro_template.yml      v1.0      v1.0   yes
           coremark_template.yml      v1.0      v1.0   yes
                fio_template.yml      v1.3      v1.3   yes
           hammerdb_template.yml      v1.0      v1.0   yes
             iozone_template.yml      v1.0      v1.0   yes
            linpack_template.yml      v1.0      v1.0   yes
           passmark_template.yml      v1.0      v1.0   yes
           phoronix_template.yml      v1.2      v1.2   yes
                pig_template.yml      v1.0      v1.0   yes
      pyperformance_template.yml      v1.0      v1.0   yes
        speccpu2017_template.yml      v1.0      v1.0   yes
            specjbb_template.yml      v1.3      v1.3   yes
            streams_template.yml      v1.1      v1.1   yes
              uperf_template.yml      v1.0      v1.1    no
----
In the example of above, we see autohpl, burst_io and uperf are not runniing the latest test.

[appendix]
=== Update config file versions to the latest (github only)
To update the test configs to be the latest version (github only) run the following command
----
$ ./burden --update_test_versions
updating test versions
Updating version for autohpl.yml from v1.0 to v1.1
Updating version for burst_io.yml from v1.1 to v1.2
Updating version for uperf_template.yml from v1.0 to v1.1
----
