Description
Zathras is an automation framework built in 5 layers.  It is designed to be easily
extendable to other cloud types, works on bare metal systems, and have new tests easily
added to it.

Name: The name Zathras is from the name of a character in the science fiction series,
Babylon 5.  Zathras did not say much, but was instrumental in keeping The Great Machine
on Epsilon III running.  One of the few things he did say was "Zathras is used to being beast
of burden to other peoples needs...very sad life...probably have very sad death...but,
at least there is symmetry!".  For many reasons, that seems fitting for this automation
tool, thus the name.

Layer 1: CLI
Usage: ./bin/burden --verbose
Version: 3.0
General options
  --archive <dir>/<results>:  location to save the archive information to
  --child: tells burden it is a child of another burden process and not to
  --dir_index: designates an index value to add to the run directory, default is 0
  --force_upload: upload all packages and tools to the cloud instance.
  --git_timeout: Number of seconds to timeout on git requests.  Default is 60
  --system_type <vendor>: aws, azure or local
  --host_config <config options>: Specification of the system and configuration
	If the --system_type option is local, then this is simply the system name
	to run on, and it will pull the config value from the file <hostname>.conf
	in local_configs
	  local_configs format:
	    server_ips:  <xx.xx.xx.xx>,<xx.xx.xx.xx>
	    client_ips: <xx.xx.xx.xx>,<xx.xx.xx.xx>
	    storage: /dev/nvme2n1,/dev/nvme1n1

	If the --system_type option is a cloud environment, then the following can
	be specified
	    config_file format:
	    Fields definition:
	      instance_type: The cloud instance size (ie i3en.xlarge).
          [region=<value>&zone=<value>] is totally optional
          region: the region the cloud is created in, defaults to
             whatever the user's default region is
          zone: The zone in the region the cloud is to be created in, if not specified
                will randomly pick one
	      number_networks: number of internal networks to create
	      sysctl_settings: files in sysctl_setting to use.  Each file
	                    sets a set of tuneables, separator is +
	      number_of_disks: How many disks to create and attach
	      disk_size: How large is the disk in gigabytes
	      disk_type: Type of disk to be created
    or
	  <instance>:<Disks>&<Networks>&<Sysctl_settings>
	    Fields definition:
	      <instance[region=<val>&zone=<val]>: The cloud instance name (ie i3en.xlarge).
	        includes region and zone requests, both are optional.
	      <Disks;number=n;size=n;type=n>
	         number: How many disks to create and attach
	         size: How large is the disk in gigabytes
	         type: Type of disk creating
	      <Networks;number=n>
	         number_networks: number of internal networks to create
	      <Sysctl_settings=n+n...>
	      sysctl_settings: files in sysctl_setting to use.  Each file
	                    sets a set of tuneables, separator is +
   System config file Examples
     Example 1: Designate 2 systems, no config options
	     m5.xlarge,m5.4xlarge
	   Example 2: Designate m5.24xlarge, 8 gp2 disks of 1200 Gig
	     m5.24xlarge:Disks;number=8;size=1200;type=gp2
	   Example 3: Designate m5.24xlarge with 4 networks
	     m5.24xlarge:Networks;number=4
	   Example 4: Designate m5.24xlarge with sys tunings udp_fix and none
	     m5.24xlarge:Sysctl_settings=none+udp_fix
	   Example 5: Designate m5.xlarge to be created in us-east-1 and zone b
	     "m5.xlarge[region=us-east-1&zone=b]"
  --java_version: java version to install, java-8, java-11
  --max_systems <n>:  Maximum number of systems to be running at once.  3 is the default
  --no_yq_checks: skips checking for proper yq installation
  --persistent_log: enable persistent logging, 0/1
  --results_prefix <prefix>: Run directory prefix
  --scenario <scenario definition file>: Reads in a scenario and then runs it
    (if used, host configs are designated in the file).  If the scenario name starts with https: or git:
    then we are retrieving the scenario from a git repo. If the line in the scenario file starts with #
    , then that line is a comment.  If the line starts with a %, it indicates to replace the string.
    Format to replace a string  % <current string>=<new string>
  --selinux_state: disabled/enabled
  --ssh_key_file: Designates the ssh file we are to use.
  --show_os_versions: given the cloud type, and OS vendor, show the available os versions
  --show_tests:  list the available test as defined in config/test_defs.yml
  --test_def_file <file>: test definition file to use.
  --test_def_dir <dir>: test definition directory.  Default is <execution dir>/config.  If
     https: or git: is at the start of the location, then we will pull from a git repo.
  --test_override <options>:  Overrides the given options for a specific test in the scenario file
    Example:
      global:
        ssh_key_file: /home/test_user/permissions/aws_region_2_ssh_key
        terminate_cloud: 1
        cloud_os_id: aminumber
        os_vendor: rhel
        results_prefix: linpack
        system_type: aws
      systems:
        system1:
          java_version: java-8
          tests: linpack
          system_type: aws
          host_config: "m5.xlarge"
        system2:
          java_version: java-8
          tests: linpack
          system_type: aws
          host_config: "m5.4xlarge"
    To override java_version for system1:
       --test_override "system1:java_version=java-11"
  --tests <test>: testname, you may use "test1,test2" to execute test1 and test2.
     Note if the option is present, we will ignore all other options passed in.
  --test_iter <iterations>: how many iterations of the test to run (includes linpack).
     For cloud instances, this will terminate the cloud image and start
     a new one for each iteration
  --test_version <test>,<test>....: Shows the versions of the test the are available
    and brief description of the version.  This only applies to git repos
  --test_version_check: Checks to see if we are running the latest versions of the tests and
    exits out when done. Default is no
  --tuned_profiles <comma separated list of tuned profiles>, only for RHEL
  --verbose: Verbose usage message
  --update_target: Image to update
    Note:  only 1 update image can be used, makes no difference
           if designate a different one for each system in the
           scenario file, the first one will be used
  -h --usage: condensed usage information
Cloud options only
  --cloud_os_id <os id>: Image of the OS to install (example aws aminumber)
  --create_only:  Only do the VM creation and OS installation.
  --os_vendor <os vendor>: currently rhel, ubuntu, amazon
  --terminate_cloud: If 1, terminate the cloud instance, if 0 leave the cloud image running.
      Default is to terminate
  --use_spot: uses spot pricing based on the contents of config/spot_price.cfg.  Default is not
      to use spot_pricing

Layer 2: Cloud Creation
  This layer creates the required cloud instances, and attaches any required devices.  Note,
  if doing network testing, another system of the same instance type is created and connected
  via a private network.

Layer 3: Test automation wrapper
  This layer is a script that is wrapped around an existing test.  Purpose of this wrapper is
  to look at the system and configuration and determine what the test options should be.  Each
  of these automation scripts have their own set of parameters, which are expected to have a default
  value that is either determined by the system configuration or simply a hard coded value.
  This layer is also expected to handle the results if layer 4 does not.

Layer 4: test
  This later is the actual test running.  It can be anything that can be automated.  The test 
  are not part of the kit, but are currently stored in 1 of 2 places on perf1.perf.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com:/pub, either in

Layer 5:  Cleanup
  This layer tears down the cloud instance, and any associated resources.

RSA files
inventory: start of the ansible inventory file, simply localhost to start with

Need following packages
dnf install python2-boto.noarch
dnf install python2-boto3.noarch
dnf install python2-botocore.noarch
dnf install python3-boto.noarch
dnf install dialog.x86_64

Using scenario_vars 
To run the general scenario regression

./burden --scenario regression_scenario --system_type aws --scenario_vars definition_vars

That will run the regression scenario in the AWS environment.

Order of option selection

There are 3 places that the options to burden may be placed in.  The following is the order in
which those options are acquired.  

1) command line options to burden.  These override any options designated in the scenario vars
   file, or the scenario file
2) scenario vars file (--scenario_vars), these are overridden by the cli, but override the options
   designated in the scenario file.
3) scenario file (--scenario), these are overridden by the options designated either via the cli or
   the scenario vars file.
